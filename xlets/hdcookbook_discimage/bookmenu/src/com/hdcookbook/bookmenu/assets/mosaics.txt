# This is the mosaics file for the main menu xlet in the HD Cookbook's
# Blu-ray disc image.  It determines the image mosaics when an
# optimized build of the show graph is done.  For this show, we
# make two mosaics.  The first is the minimum set of images needed
# for the "loading" animation, and the second is all the rest of
# the images.
