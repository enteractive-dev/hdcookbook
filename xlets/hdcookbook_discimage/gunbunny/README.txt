This directory contains the original Gun Bunny game
that's included on the HD cookbook disc image.  This version was
made before GRIN was extended to provide support for this kind
of game.  A new version of the same game that's built using GRIN
called GrinBunny is available as a stand-along disc image.  It's
available in xlets/grin_samples/GrinBunny.
