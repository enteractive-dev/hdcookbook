This is a test for the Progressive Playlist.  To simplify the setup, 
the files used for the progressive playlist is created and bundled into 
the disc image (under BDMV/JAR/vfs.jar).   The xlet unzips the content 
into the binding unit data area, performs the vfs update, enables the 
clip, and plays back the video that is listed as a progressive playlist 
asset in the VFS update.

When you run this xlet, it describes what it's doing on the screen.  After
it finishes, be sure to pop it out of the player and put it back in -- that
shows what happens when it discovers old files in the BUDA.

See the screenshots in the doc directory to see what this should look
like.
