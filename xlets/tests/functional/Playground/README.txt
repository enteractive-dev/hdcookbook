This xlet was created to test various features of GRIN.  Often, when a
new feature is added to GRIN, it is used in the menu xlet as a way of
testing it, but not all new features naturally fit into the menu xlet.
This xlet was invented as a catch-all to be able to test new features
of GRIN, and maybe in the future for new features of other components.
