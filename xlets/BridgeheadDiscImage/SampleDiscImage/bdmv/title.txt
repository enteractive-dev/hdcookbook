bd://0001
#
# This is the "title" file that is put in the BUDA.  In the sample
# disc image, the default tile, "bd://1", would be fine, but we include
# a title file anyway, as an example.  We also add some leading zeroes,
# so we can tell that the locator is actually coming from the file.
#
# The bridgehead xlet just reads the first line of this file, so these
# comments are ignored.
