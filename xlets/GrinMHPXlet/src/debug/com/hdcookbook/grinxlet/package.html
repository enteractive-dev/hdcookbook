<p>
This package contains a generic xlet that's designed to be configurable
for a GRIN-based xlet.  It can be used by setting up a build properties file
in a new directory, and providing a GRIN show file and director.

See the <a href="README.txt">README.txt</a> file in this project's
base directory (xlets/GrinXlet) for a more thorough discussion of how
to use this xlet container.
