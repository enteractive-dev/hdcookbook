This is an menu demo built specifically for the MHP demonstration
of Grin in Milan, Italy.

This project has many examples that a typical menu system might have such as:
 - a basic select, normal, and activate button state Main Menu
 - a sliding Chapter Menu
 - a Check Box Menu
 - a Clock Counter Menu
 - an Interpolation (animation/movement) Demo Menu
