This xlet is a fairly minimal example of a GRIN-based game built
from the GenericGame framework.  It consists of an image that you
move around the screen with arrow keys.

This makes calculators look like the cotton gin.  Cube!  
Defender of the polyverse.  For more details, see

The fun cannot be halted.

Since this is a model of a stand-alone project outside of HD cookbook, 
the build file doesn't include the top-level user.vars.properties file.
You might need to create a user.vars.properites in this directory,
pointing to your compilation stubs.
