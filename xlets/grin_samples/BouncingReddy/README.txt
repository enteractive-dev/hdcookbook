This sample program demonstrates the 28 easing algorithms supported
by the GRIN compiler.  It does this by applying each easing algorithm
in turn to a translation of Reddy Kilowatt from the bottom to the
top of the screen, then scooting him back down for the next round.

The show file for this is highly repetitive, so it's generated by
a short Java program that you'll find in other_src/ShowMaker.java
