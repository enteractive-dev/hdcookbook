This directory contains a little Twitter viewing xlet.  It was
developed in a little under a day, to demonstrate building a
"Yahoo widgets"-style widget using GRIN.  It was inspired by a
JavaFX widget, but the Twitter connection stuff was taken from
a CLDC twitter widget we found by googling "twitter CLDC client".
