This directory contains various GRIN demos.  Some of them aren't
included in the stand-alone build, while every one can be built with
its own independent build system.  That is, each one needs its own
user.vars.properties to be able to build it individually.

These should be considered "use at your own risk" - we don't
maintin them.  We do try pretty hard to make sure that GRIN
maintains backwards compatibility, but it's possible that bitrot 
might set in some day...
