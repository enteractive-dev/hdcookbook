This directory has a little shooting game in it.  It's built up
progressively, from version 01, which is a minimal GRIN scenegraph
to put a picture of a shoe on the screen, up to version 07, which
is the full game.  Version 08 adds some physics to the game.

This demo was split into eight parts for use at a talk, trying
to show a stepwise development process.
