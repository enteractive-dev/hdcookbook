This package contains a program that compiles a show file.
It reads it, generates a binary show file, and optionally
transforms all image assets to a mosaic.
</p><p>
Mosaic making is done using a
fairly brute-force "first fit" algorithm that isn't completely
optimal, but seems to work quite well in practice.
When run, this program produces a modified set of assets 
to be used with the show file.  The show file itself doesn't need to
be modified, because a "map" file is produced that maps the filename
of the original image to a set of coordinates within a matrix file.  Just
package up the map file and the matrixes, and leave out the original
images in the disc image.
</p><p>
This is a build-time tool that runs with the JDK.  It requires parts
of the GRIN library to run, so you should probably just build the
whole thing. 
<p>
In your application, you need to tell GRIN where the image map file
is.  For debugging purposes, It's sometimes handy to set an xlet up so
that it will work with either the discrete images or the mosaic, to
speed build times.  In the HD cookbook menu, I did this, right after
setting <code>AssetFinder</code>'s search path:
</p>
<pre>
        if (AssetFinder.tryURL("images.map") != null) { 
            if (Debug.LEVEL > 0) {
                Debug.println("Found images.map, using mosaic.");
            }
            AssetFinder.setImageMap("images.map"); 
        } else if (Debug.LEVEL > 0) {
                Debug.println("No images.map, not using mosaic.");
        }
</pre>
<p>
As of this writing, the mosaic construction algorithm isn't fully
optimized, and the mosaic image
can only be in PNG.  Some players decode JPEG faster than PNG, but
JPEG doesn't support alpha and you have to worry about setting the
quality of JPEG output if you go that route.  This tool presently
doesn't have a way of grouping related images together, which would
be important for managing image loading and unloading if you can't
just keep everything in memory.
