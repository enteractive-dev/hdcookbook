This package contains classes used to build GRIN show nodes.
They can be considered to be utilities for Java SE programs that
create a binary show file, or other file read at runtime on a player.
Any features or other elements defined in this package don't directly
appear at runtime, but instead are transformed into other types that
do exist at runtime.
