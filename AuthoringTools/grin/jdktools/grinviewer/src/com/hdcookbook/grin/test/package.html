This package contains some support for testing GRIN.  The "Ryan"
you'll see referenced comes from a demo called "Ryan's Life".  GRIN
was originally developed by Sun for the Ryan's Life demo produced
by Sun and Technicolor.  Originally, it was run on an MHP set top
box to demonstrate Java in a television environment.
</p><p>
This package contains generic testing code.  In the directory
"bigjdk", you'll find classes to support running GRIN using
desktop Java (formally Java SE).  At the time of this writing,
a BD-J xlet version of the "Ryan's Life" test was not provided,
but by the time you read this there may be a BD-J xlet version in
a different subpackage.
</p><p>
To see how to launch GRIN on Java SE, see the
<b>com.hdcookbook.grin.test.bigjdk</b> package
documentation</a>.
</p><p>
"Ryan's Life" was never intended to show optimal coding practices
for the platform, so please don't take it that way.  In a real
title, significantly more attention would be paid to things like
the organization of assets and player performance levels, in order
to guarantee timely behavior.
