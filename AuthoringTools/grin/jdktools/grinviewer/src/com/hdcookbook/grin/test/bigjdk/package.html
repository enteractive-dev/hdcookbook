This package contains support for testing GRIN on "big JDK," more
formally known as Java SE.  This can be a useful thing to do while
debugging scripts, because with big JDK, you typically have access
to a much richer suite of debugging tools, and more convenient
access to an IDE like NetBeans.
</p><p>
The downside of developing on big JDK is that the GEM and Blu-ray
APIs aren't available.  For GRIN, we put some minimal stub classes
in <code>org.dvb</code> in the workspace, but these are by no means a complete
implementation of those APIs.  Rather, they're just enough to bootstrap
a functional method for testing GRIN using desktop Java.
</p><p>
In this package, there are two ways of launching the "Ryan's Life"
demo:
</p>
<pre>
    java -cp (dir) com.hdcookbook.grin.test.bigjdk.GrinTestRyan

    java -cp (dir) com.hdcookbook.grin.test.bigjdk.GuiGenericMain \
        -assets ../test/assets/ ryan_show.txt 6
</pre>
<p>
The first is a more complete test of Ryan's Life, with a program
that implements the ryan-specific command extensions in the script.
It correctly runs Ryan at the normal PAL/SECAM SD resolution.
</p><p>
The second test is a cool little program that displays the parse
tree of the Ryan script in a Swing hierarchy widget.  You can
double-click on a segment to activate that segment, and you can
single-step through animations frame-by-frame.  This can be a useful
debugging tool if you have a one-frame "flash" artifact in your
script, and you don't understand why.  This "generic" version assumes
a 24p HD display (1920x1280), and it does graphics  plane compositing
in software, so it's slow.  I find I have to back the frame rate down
to about 6 fps, even on a fast PC.  That's what the last command-line
argument is for.
