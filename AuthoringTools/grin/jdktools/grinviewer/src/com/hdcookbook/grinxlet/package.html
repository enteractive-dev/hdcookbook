This directory contains the GrinXlet API for Java SE/Grinview.
A project that uses GrinXlet can refer to the public API in this
package, in places like its director.  This package is the Java SE
version of GrinView.  Any public APIs here can be safely used from
the director's code, and will work both within Grinview, and within
a real xlet.
