<p>
This package and its subpackages contains the optional fontstrip extension.
Projects that include this extension can use a "fontstrip" feature to
display text.  A fontstrip relies on images of letters that are pre-rendered
into a .png file during the compilation process.
<p>
See the file READM.TXT in the font strip extension base directory
for more details.
