<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>It's a collaborative
community space for promoting Java content on blu-ray disc (BD)
players.  We also wish to promote content for GEM-based
platforms other than BD-J.  This project is hosted by a few developers
at Sun who are enthusiastic about the technology.  </FONT>

<a name="2"/><P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT><li>Why the name &quot;HD
Cookbook&quot;?</FONT></P>
</b>
<p> The name &quot;HD Cookbook&quot; is inspired by the title of a
book on developing interactive applications for Blu-ray Java and the other
HD optical media format.  See <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> for more about this book, and a list of other Blu-ray resources. </p>

<b>
<a name="3"/><P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT><li>Who is the target
audience for this project?</FONT></P>
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>Anyone interersted in
Java-based content authoring for TV, of course!</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>In reality, this project
seems to attract interesting mix of blu-ray content authors.  On one
spectrum, there are independent developers wishing to run their first
Java application on a BD player they have purchased.  On the other
spectrum, there are content authors involved in commercial BD title
production.  The latter audience have access to industrial-strength
BD authoring tools already, but they join this project because
sometimes our tools provide functionality or fill the need that
commercial tools do not necessarily cover.  Then, there are audience
who fall in between those two spectrums, such as those who are
evaluating BD-J as a business opportunity and using our tools for
doing experimental work.
</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>
We are beginning to see interest from the OCAP community,
as well.  Most of the framework code is directly applicable
to an OCAP environment, or to other GEM-based environments,
like MHP.  Also, a Blu-ray player is an attractive
device for people who are prototyping application ideas and services
that might ultimately deploy on OCAP or MHP, because Blu-ray players
are inexpensive, and they have performance characteristics that are
similar to real OCAP/MHP devices. </FONT></P>

What tools does this project provide?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>Our tools are divided into
two sections, DiscCreationTools and AuthoringTools. 
DiscCreationTools consists of tools mainly for assembling a valid BD
structure, whereas AuthoringTools are the tools to ease and enable
innovative content authoring.   Most likely, you'll be using
only a subset of the tools in the repository, depending on what
you're trying to do.</FONT></P>

<BR>

<b>
<a name="5"/><li>
What sample code does this project provide?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>All our samples are under
the &quot;xlet&quot; directory in the hdcookbook.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>"hdcookbook_discimage" is by
far the most complete BD image sample.  This disc image includes
three xlets demonstrating typical features that a typical movie-like
disc might want to do, such as having a menu to allow scene and
subtitle selection, a bonus game, a feature to connect to the
internet to download a new image, etc.  </FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>We also have many samples
for GRIN.  GRIN is an application framework tool provided under
AuthoringTools.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>There are also independent

examples and test cases, in which we've built over time, usually for
some specific BD feature.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>All samples come with an
ant build setup, and can be made into a complete BD image so that one
can run on a player.  By default, the build setup for samples require hdcookbook tools to be pre-built.</FONT></P>

How do you decide what to provide in the project?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>Sometimes we built the
tools because we needed them.  In many other cases, we built, or
enhanced, our tools, when someone we're working with had a need.  
</FONT></P>

<BR>

<b>
<a name="7"/><li>
What skills do I need to have to use the repository effectively?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>At minimum, we expect you
to be reasonably familiar with Java as programming language to get
started.  Also, our source code repository is built with ant, so some
knowledge on ant build script will be handy.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>Please note that this
project currently do not provide tutorial-type writeup on how to do
BD-J programming.   We hope that hdcookbook's sample
disc images and their build system setup can serve as examples.</FONT></P>

How can I get started with running my Java application on Playstation 3 (PS3)?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>I suggest you to start
with a xlet/HelloWorldXlet sample, because it is the simplest Blu-ray
Disc image example we have in the hdcookbook source code repository. 
Once you have that image running successfully on your Playstation 3,
then you can try changing the application to suit your need. 
The build setup for samples require hdcookbook tools to be pre-built.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>If you are searching for a way to
execute your Java application from a USB stick, then
you need to convert a BD image to another format called AVCHD before
placing it on a memory stick.  There is an experimental tool under
AuthoringTools/experimental that can do this BD to AVCHD conversion
for you.  Unfortunately, we have been informed that the support for
running Java application from a USB stick has been discontinued in
Playstation 3 firmware update v2.50 altogether.</FONT></P>

<b>
<a name="9"/><li>
I'm new to the Java programming language, can I still use hdcookbook?
</b>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>The project should still
help you, but we suggest you to try learning at least the basics concepts of Java.   Our tools are all written in Java themselves, so if you have zero knowledge about Java, your experience with them might become rather frustrating.  Also, chances are, if you're reading this FAQ, then you're interested
in BD-J, so you will need the basic skill to do your own application
programming sooner or later.  See <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/thread.jspa?messageID=270553">this posting</a> for
suggestions on where to start. </FONT> </P>

<b>
<a name="10"/><li>
What additional resources do I need for BD-J development environment in order to use hdcookbook? 
</b>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>At miminum, you'll need to
add these two items:</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>1. A set of classes (BD-J
compilation stubs) to compile your application against.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>2. An environment to test
your BD image on.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>For 1, see <a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Mobileandembedded/BDJPlatformDefinition">this wiki article</a>
for an instruction on where to get the stub files.</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>For 2, there are various
options.  Ideally one should have an PC player with a debugging
capability to reasonably test the application, and a BD-RE burner to
further test the application on a range of commercial BD players.  </FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>
In addition, you'll want reference materials, like perhaps the
HD cookbook and Blu-Ray Disc Demystified.  For OCAP or MHP, you might
consider "Interactive TV Standards" by Morris and Smith-Chaigneau.
For serious commercial development on Blu-ray, you'll
need the full Blu-ray specifications, which are available from the
Blu-ray Disc Association under various commercial licenses.

What is the GRIN framework?  How is it useful to me?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>If you are new to a concept called a scene graph, it might be hard to see the power of GRIN right away.  Note that you don't need to know
about GRIN to write your first BD-J application.  In fact, you don't
have to rely on GRIN at all to do BD-J authoring if you choose to.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>That said, we believe that
GRIN is a wonderful application framework that can free you, content
authors, from Java programming details and allow you to focus on the
design and the behavior of the content instead.  GRIN provides a way
to declare content as a scene graph - what we call a Show file.  It is a scene graph implementation architected and developed primarily
for the BD platform, and it is highly efficient.  GRIN runs on top of
our animation framework, which handles all the complicated frame
refreshing logic for you so that your content looks good together
with the video plane running behind Java's graphics plane.  Each
scene can include logic for handling user input.  You can declare all
the scene nodes statically, or call into Java layer.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>See <a href="grin.html">this GRIN overview documentation</a> for more information.</FONT></P>

Can I use hdcookbook resources for other GEM based development environents such as MHP or OCAP?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>Definitely.  Tools under AuthoringTools are generic and we are aiming them to be applicable to GEM based platform overall.  Many tools under DiscCreationTools directory might be BD specific, meanwhile.  See also question #3, "target audience for this project". </FONT></P>

What does the sumo wrestler logo mean?
</b>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0in"><FONT>It is Bill Foote's humor. 
BDA, or Blu-ray Disc Association, includes many Japanese
manufactorers as its board members.  Thus he chose this logo of a
sumo wrestler working hard to cook with a reference book, where the
book, presumably, is <a href="http://www.hdcookbook.com">the HD Cookbook</a>.</FONT></P>
