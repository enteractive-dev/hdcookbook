<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>

Welcome to the HD Cookbook source repository!  This repository contains
a set of tools that can be used for BD-J, OCAP, MHP and other GEM devices
like GEM-IPTV.  It includes tools for animation, for 
creating user experiences using a scene graph, and for creating 
Blu-ray disc images.  The tools in this repository have been used
for a number of commercial Blu-ray Disc titles from several studios,
and as part of the production workflow from major names in the Blu-ray
production industry.  We welcome contributions, so if you 
have something you'd like to contribute, please do!  All we ask 
is a little bit of coordination on package names, and a few simple 
formatting conventions. 
</p>
<p>
If you are visiting out site for the first time, <a href="faq.html">this FAQ page</a> about the project might help you.
</p>

<p>
Here's what we have so far in our repository: 
</p>
Under "AuthoringTools" directory, we have:  
<ul> 
    <li> <a href="animator.html">Animator</a>, a lightweight animation package.
         This package manages the animation loop, drawing optimization, 
	 and double-buffering for a Java Xlet, such as a BD-J application.
    <li> <a href="grin.html">GRIN -
	a framework for Graphical Interactivity.</a>  This framework uses the
	animation framework described above, and adds a "scene graph" to it.
	A scene graph is the thing that, at runtime, represents what gets
	built with a visual design tool.  It's a tree of objects that 
	represents drawing operations, much like an HTML document or a 
	Flash file.
    <li><a href="profiler.html">Profiler</a>, a facility for execution-time
         profiling of BD-J xlets.  It can be used to collect data from
	 any BD-Live player where the xlet is run, so it works well for
	 measuring performance on real, production hardware.
</ul>
Under "xlets" directory, we have various sample code, including:  
<ul> 
    <li>The GrinXlet frameword, in 
        <code><strong>xlets/GrinXlet</strong></code>.
        This framework automates most of the build process for a single-xlet
	disc, and helps you to structure a project so the application logic
	can be debugged on Java SE using grinview.  It's pretty extensively
	described in the <strong>GrinXlet README.txt file</strong>.
    <li>Various demo programs (many built with the GrinXlet framework)
        in 
	<code><strong>xlets/demos</strong></code>
	and 
	<code><strong>xlets/grin_samples</strong></code>.
    <li>A set of three Blu-ray Java xlets that can be used in a BD disc 
        image, under "hdcookbook_discimage".  There's a main menu xlet that uses GRIN in the package
    <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.menu</strong>, a game 
    called &quot;Gun Bunny&quot; in <strong>com.hdcookbook.gunbunny</strong>, 
    and a &quot;monitor xlet&quot; to control
    the other apps in <strong>com.hdcookbook.bookmenu.monitor</strong>.
    A BD disc image with A/V assets can be found in the download section of this project.  It is ready to have the three xlets described above added to it.  Put these together on a BD-RE disc,
	and you have a disc image you can play on an off-the-shelf
	Blu-Ray Disc player, like the PS3!
    <li>A project HelloWorldXlet, which can create a simple Blu-ray Disc image that displays "Hello World!" string on a BD player.
</ul>
Under "DiscCreationTools" directory, we have various tools to assemble a Blu-ray Disc image, including:
<ul>
    <li>A tool to build a Blu-ray Disc BDJO file 
    in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.bdjo</strong>.
    <li>A set of security tools that generate certificates, sign Blu-ray Disc
    jar files, sign Binding Unit Manifest File (BUMF), and sign jars with file
    credentials in <strong>net.java.bd.tools.security</strong>.  See the
    <a href="security_readme.html">Security README file</a> for more details.
</ul>
<p>
This code is being used in production Blu-ray titles, including
major studio releases.
</p>

<h2>Blu-ray Java resources</h2>
<p>
Many Blu-ray resources are listed at
    <a href="http://hdcookbook.com">http://hdcookbook.com</a> under
    "Blu-ray Disc Java Resources."  This includes a
    BD-J <a href="http://forums.java.net/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=117">discussion forum</a>,
        the linked <a href="https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net/servlets/SummarizeList?listName=bd-j-dev">mailing list</a>, and the
	<a href="http://wiki.java.net/bin/view/Mobileandembedded/Blu-RayDisc">BD-J
	Authoring Notes and Guidelines Wiki</a>.
</p>
<h2>Playing a Blu-ray Disc Image at Home</h2>
<p>
By assembling the parts available here, you can build your own
Blu-ray Disc image, and burn it to a rewritable BD-RE disc.  This
disc can be played almost all consumer players, including the PS3.
You can also modify the BD-J code provided, or write your own.  Soon,
we hope to assmeble enough tools so you can build a disc image from
scratch:  We'd like it to be possible for folks who are interested to
shoot their own HD footage, edit it with something like Final Cut,
build the disc data structures, write code for the interactivity, and
emerge with a BD-RE disc that will work on a normal Blu-ray player.
<p>For everything but the disc image, you'll need to hook up to 
the SVN repository and 
do a bringover.  That process is described in the java.net pages.  When 
I wrote this, there was a link for &quot;Subversion&quot; under &quot;Project tools&quot; that explained how to do this.</p>
<p>
For the disc image, look under "Documents &amp; Files" on the menu bar
on the right, then grab the file 2007_10_hdcookbook_disc_image_no_jar_bdjo.zip.  The link to it is <a href="https://hdcookbook.dev.java.net/files/documents/7269/71484/2007_10_hdcookbook_disc_image_no_jar_bdjo.zip">here</a>.  An earlier version from August is also available, but that version has
an AACS directory and has content protection flags set in the transport
streams.  This was fixed in the October disc image, which is known to
play correctly on a PS3 (once the xlets are compiled and added to the
image).
