<h2>HD Cookbook - The Animation Framework</h2>
<p>
This project includes a well-developed animation framework
that's well suited to the needs of Blu-ray, and other television
platforms based on PBP, like OCAP and MHP.  This framework
gives the programmer and author the tools needed to create
time-based animation withoptimized drawing, where only the areas
of the screen that have changed are re-drawn.  The 
<a href="grin.html"><u>GRIN scene graph</u></a>
uses this animation framework, but the animation framework can also
be used in a stand-alone fashion.  It features an open architecture that
allows drawing from multiple sources to be combined into the same
presentation, with drawing from different source stacked to top of
eachother.  This allows any Java program to, for example, draw both
under and over the drawing produced from a GRIN scene graph.
</p><p>Key to achieving good
animation framework is to optimize the drawing operations, so that
the number of pixels tha need to be copied for each frame are minimized.
A good animation framework also needs a solid threading model, so that
application programmers don't have to worry too much about mulit-threading.
</p><p>
There are important workflow differences between development for TV
platform and the web:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>In web design, the target device is usually a fast PC, and a large
        amount of content needs to be created cheaply.  Both factors argue
	against performance optimization.
    <li>In TV design, production values like seamless presentation and
        reliable execution on all devices are critical.
    <li>For most TV projects like a Blu-ray disc, there is the role of
        <b>author</b>.  This highly technical role within the workflow is
	a natural place to optimize and tune presentation, so that the
	graphics designer's intent is optimally realized on the target
	medium.
</ul>
<p>
The GRIN animation framework was built around this understanding of
the workflow, that runs from design, to authoring, to mastering, to
replication.  A similar workflow is expected for professional TV
production in other domains, like IPTV.
</p><p>
The image at the top of this document is a screen grab of a desktop tool
that an author can use to visualize and tune the drawing operations
performed in an animation.  An author can group together related sets
of drawings (perhaps those co-located on the screen), and can provide
other information that helps the drawing engine to minimize the drawing
that needs to be done.  In the screen grab, the areas to be erased are
showin in red.  The turtles are moving to the right, but because they fill
a rectangular area with opaque pixels, only the left side of the previous
image needs to be erased.  The GRIN show that produced this frame is in the
file grin/samples/GrinViewerXlet/show.txt, and can be run with the command
&quot;grin/scripts/shell/run_grinviewer.sh test&quot;.
</p><p>
The GRIN animation framework has these design goals:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Runtime efficiency and speed
    <li>Small code size (around 10K)
    <li>Little or no production of heap objects during animation,
        so that GC won't be triggered
    <li>Support for maintaining a constant animation rate by dropping 
        frames, rather than slowing down the visual results.
    <li>Simple, deadlock-free threading model
    <li>Freely availabile, with no royalties.
</ul>

Framework Usage</u></a> document.
