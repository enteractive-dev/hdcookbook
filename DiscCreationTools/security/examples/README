This is a simple example that to show that the
certificate signing and the jar signing using 
the BDSigner works for an applet.

To run the example use:
	"run.bat" on windows 

and run-unix.sh on Unix platforms

Note "writefile.policy" file grants permission for
the applet to perform I/O operations on the system.

The permission is granted only if the jar is signed
by the specified "alias" name present in the specified
keystore.
